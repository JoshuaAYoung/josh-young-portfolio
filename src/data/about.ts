    'I live life at the intersection where creativity and engineering meet, transforming complex problems into elegant solutions. Whether itâ€™s setting up a backend service or crafting a frontend interface that users actually enjoy using, I approach every challenge with curiosity and meticulous attention to detail. That said, Iâ€™m big on collaboration, and my proven ability to bridge technical and creative perspectives plays a key role in the great results Iâ€™ve delivered (re: projects ðŸ‘‡).',
  secondParagraph:
    'Maybe itâ€™s an oversimplification, but I feel like it all leads back to being motivated by quality. Not an always-get-it-on-the-first-try kind of quality. But a quality born of an almost giddy persistence; to find the answers even if it makes me look naÃ¯ve for asking; to put my heart into collaborating as a team for the sake of the finished product (doesnâ€™t hurt that itâ€™s also fun); to push myself to learn and grow, every single day, even when it feels uncomfortable.',
